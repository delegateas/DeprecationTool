# Deprecation Tool for xRM
This is the repo containing the Deprecation Tool XrmToolBox plugin.
The purpose of this plugin is to deprecate entity attributes. When we say deprecate, we mean:
* Prepend a deprecation prefix, such as "zz_"
* Mark attribute not valid for advanced search
* Add custom attribute deprecation timestamp in the description

The tools allows you to easy check/uncheck for deprecation/favoring of attributes.
This is an early revision of the tool, but we've made sure not to do any destructive operations, we only update!
